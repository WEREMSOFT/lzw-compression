The LZW algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. The LZW algorithm is widely used in many applications. The LZW algorithm was published by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch in 1984. The algorithm builds a dictionary of repeating patterns as it processes the input data. The algorithm is particularly effective for data with repeating patterns and sequences. The algorithm is used in GIF image compression, Unix compress utility, and many other applications.
